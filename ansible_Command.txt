Check connectivity of hosts

We have used this command in our previous tutorial also. The command to check connectivity of hosts is

# ansible <group> -m ping


Checking host’s system information

Ansible collects the system’s information for all the hosts connected to it. To display the information of hosts, run

# ansible <group> -m setup | less

Secondly, to check a particular info from the collected information by passing an argument,

# ansible <group> -m setup -a "filter=ansible_distribution"
Transferring files


So to manage the users on the connected hosts, we use a module named ‘user’ & commands to use it are as follows,

Creating a new user

# ansible <group> -m user -a "name=ansible password=<encrypted password>"


Deleting a user

# ansible <group> -m user -a "name=ansible state=absent"

check user is present

#getent passwd | grep test1



For transferring files, we use a module ‘copy’ & complete command that is used is

# ansible <group> -m copy -a "src=/home/ansible dest=/tmp/home"
Managing users

Changing permissions & ownership

So for changing ownership of files of connected hosts, we use module named ‘file’ & commands used are

Changing permission of a file

# ansible <group> -m file -a "dest=/home/ansible/file1.txt mode=777"
Changing ownership of a file

# 
Managing Packages

So, we can manage the packages installed on all the hosts connected to ansible by using ‘yum’ & ‘apt’ modules & the complete commands used are

Check if package is installed & update it

# ansible <group> -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=latest"
Check if package is installed & don’t update it

# ansible <group> -m apt -a "name=apache2 state=present"
So to manage services with ansible, we use modules ‘service’ & complete commands that are used are,

Starting a service

# ansible <group> -m service -a "name=apache2 state=started"
Stopping a service

# ansible <group> -m service -a "name=apache2 state=stopped"
Restarting a service

# ansible <group> -m service -a "name=apache2 state=restarted"
